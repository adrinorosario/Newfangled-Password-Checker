### A hash function is simply a function that generates a value of fixed length for each input that it gets. It is used all across computer science. There are many types.

### 'AAF4C61DDCC5E8A2DABEDE0F3B482CD9AEA9434D' is the hash{SHA1} of the string 'hello'

```

KEY ASPECTS OF HASH FUNCTION:
1. It's one way. It is impossible to guess the input of a hash.
2. Change in the string input will result in change in hash.
3. Same input for a number of times results in same output hash.
4. You will have no way to convert a hash to the imput it was converted for. This is called 'Idempotent'. It is a way of saying- 'a function given an input[same like-'hello'] always results the same output'
```

### Benefit of Using HASH in a DATA STRUCTURE is that we get really fast data access.

### Every time you add or retrieve a value/property  from memory, you want it to be fast. Hash tables are impemented with an optimum hashing function that's really fast.

### Some hashing fuction take a really long time to retrieve/add properties.
